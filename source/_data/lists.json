Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee.\n\nA note on identifiers: \n\nA SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. \n\nThe SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business.\n\n\"A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number.
